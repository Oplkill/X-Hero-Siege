TODO DOTA:



death in arena timer not lonmg enough and maybe finish the event

artas bash reduce

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

make triggers bigger

maybe rewrite the arena event to save everything in a list with nubmer as key, and find all units in each arena and port them back manually. -> dont let them blink outside arena

maybe make blink a blink dagger baseclass, so that you can prevent blink

beast event getting finsihed without killing
