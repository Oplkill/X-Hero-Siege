TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

beast event getting finsihed without killing

roshan event and blink

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Special event timing doesn't fit (Ramero Baristal)

Special events and final wave




IMPORTANT:

Change globals to be saved in the gameMode

fix tower remove invulnerable without creeps spawn

Damage over time from dead creeps can crash game

Fix special events creeps

player reconnect


DONE:

- blademaster illusions now giving kills and shouldnt bug the game anymore on special event ending

- player owned units get teleported to arena and to roshan, units of leavers get removed on this occasion

- you get respawned if you were dead at the start of the roshan and arena event

- Fixed special event triggers not working correctly

- grom illusion working again as intended, 
  kept the behaviour in extreme mode though, just with a limit of about 20 units at a time

- Added special dragon attack
