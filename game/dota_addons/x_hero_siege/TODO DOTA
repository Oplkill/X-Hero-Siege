TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

-All Hero Image challenge missing ( All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

Special events and final wave

Special events on death

blink in combination with check is path is possible

Model spirit beast change to thunderhide

Roshan ai

stat board

roshan has truesight?

drop a sellable flag after each 



EXTREMEM MODE IDEAS:

1) Death is permanent, ankhs still working.
2) Additional creeps (mb like heroes from vanilla) :
Type A: will explode on death dealing magic or pure damage (orcs)
Type B: active desolation debuff, like slardar's/bh's one (night elves)
Type C: disarm (humans)
Type D: decrepify (undead)
3) On illusion event 3 illusions spawns instead of one (If you enter the arena at game start you will die after exactly 3 hits, therefore 3 illusions)
4) Magnus globally casts his aoe-based fire spell since start (after some warning, like red circles on the ground when casting meteor in Diablo, you know what I mean)



IMPORTANT:

Change globals to be saved in the gameMode

player reconnect

disconnected players receive skillpoints

paladin healing wave cast on no target

make threat ability  berserkers call

descriptions to summon units

change boss spawn, or dont skip arenas

fountain of health
