TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

beast event getting finsihed without killing

roshan event and blink

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Special event timing doesn't fit (Ramero Baristal)

Special events and final wave

Phase 2 activating equally

Gold at events




IMPORTANT:

Change globals to be saved in the gameMode

fix tower remove invulnerable without creeps spawn

Damage over time from dead creeps can crash game



DONE:

made crypt lord beetles not stack and fixed crypt lord spawn bug

added better level up system, 

changed when the level up and dragon attacks appear

added warden 

reduced the amount of creeps spawning at level 4, only two of each type are spawning per wave

fixed lane opening after destroyed rax

The special events now end on pickup of the items not after time, so you have to pickup the items to end the events

Removed damage on lich frost frenzy, because of possible crash reason
