TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

make triggers bigger

maybe rewrite the arena event to save everything in a list with nubmer as key, and find all units in each arena and port them back manually. -> dont let them blink outside arena

maybe make blink a blink dagger baseclass, so that you can prevent blink

beast event getting finsihed without killing

Remove leaving player's hero or just kill him and don't let him respawn

roshan event and blink

ank selling

teleport units to mag and final wave
