TODO DOTA:

beast event getting finsihed without killing

roshan event and blink

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Special event timing doesn't fit (Ramero Baristal)

Special events and final wave
