TODO DOTA:

-All Hero Image challenge missing ( All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

Special events and final wave

Special events on death

blink in combination with check is path is possible

Roshan ai

stat board

roshan has truesight?

drop a sellable flag after each 



EXTREMEM MODE IDEAS:

1) Death is permanent, ankhs still working.
2) Additional creeps (mb like heroes from vanilla) :
Type A: will explode on death dealing magic or pure damage (orcs)
Type B: active desolation debuff, like slardar's/bh's one (night elves)
Type C: disarm (humans)
Type D: decrepify (undead)
3) On illusion event 3 illusions spawns instead of one (If you enter the arena at game start you will die after exactly 3 hits, therefore 3 illusions)
4) Magnus globally casts his aoe-based fire spell since start (after some warning, like red circles on the ground when casting meteor in Diablo, you know what I mean)



IMPORTANT:

Change globals to be saved in the gameMode

player reconnect

disconnected players receive skillpoints

paladin healing wave cast on no target

make threat ability berserkers call

descriptions to summon units

change boss spawn, or dont skip arenas

fountain of health

notification before roshan

tp scroll

orb of darkness, fire and shock

give summons pure orb attackss




DONE:

changed top bosses spawn you can't skip them anymore you have to kill them in order for the next to appear

 Event infernal spirit beast and illuison shouldn't end too early if another player has canceled the same event earlier	

Fixed Bloodmage, Jaina, Dreadlord
