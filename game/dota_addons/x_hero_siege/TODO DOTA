TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

beast event getting finsihed without killing

roshan event and blink

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Special event timing doesn't fit (Ramero Baristal)

Special events and final wave

Phase 2 activating equally

Gold at events


Triggers not working as supposed
2 heroes can trigger the same event




IMPORTANT:

Change globals to be saved in the gameMode

fix tower remove invulnerable without creeps spawn

Damage over time from dead creeps can crash game



DONE:


spirit of vengeacne stack

Fixed disconnect bug

Set the triggers further back at the special events


Fixed the bug that caused the game client(of the host) to crash if the host disconnected.

Put the telport point of the special event further away from the trigger.

Fixed spirit of vengeance stacking on spawn.
