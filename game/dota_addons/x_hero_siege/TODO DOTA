TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

make triggers bigger

maybe rewrite the arena event to save everything in a list with nubmer as key, and find all units in each arena and port them back manually. -> dont let them blink outside arena

maybe make blink a blink dagger baseclass, so that you can prevent blink

beast event getting finsihed without killing

Remove leaving player's hero or just kill him and don't let him respawn

roshan event and blink

ankh selling

teleport units to mag and final wave

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Dragon Attack during the waves might be a little too hard for new players

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

-Cannon Tower seems a little too OP, more OP than I remembered.

-Game scales from hard to extremely easy after the monster arena event, because lane creeps do not upgrade like the old one did (Level 1 to 4 upgrades on attack, defense and HP)

Wave kill limit based on players

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Banehallow stampede particle not showing



DONE:


New Lane command

Fixed shield of invincibility and lich frost frenzy interaction (Cause of crash, since damage return and damage from self caused an infinite loop)

Made items dagger, bracer and claws stackable

Added level up system

Difficulty system

Added attack speed to proudmoore, illidan, balanar and grom

grom uses mirror image more often,

illidan negative energy more damage and pure

attack speed of illidan metamorphosis
