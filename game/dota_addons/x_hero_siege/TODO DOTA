TODO DOTA:

spawn banehallow stuff

dont skip magtheridon

beast event getting finsihed without killing

Remove leaving player's hero or just kill him and don't let him respawn

roshan event and blink

ankh selling

-Hero Image and All Hero Image challenge missing (Hero Image +100 all stats, All Hero Image grants immunity to spells and magic)

-Challenges can be retried (used to be one try per player only)

-Glyphs at the bottom left is missing (can't remember what they did, restore health?)

-New players will have no idea what to do after farming gates. A little tutorial path with some ground flares would be nice

-Cannon Tower seems a little too OP, more OP than I remembered.

greevil end event to early

special events end on item pickup

Special event timing doesn't fit (Ramero Baristal)

Special events and final wave
